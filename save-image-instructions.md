To complete the header setup, please:

1. **Save the attached image** as `max-verstappen.jpg` in the `public/images/` folder

The Header component is already configured to:
- Display the image at 80px × 80px
- Use rounded corners (circular)
- Show next to "Max Verstappen" heading
- Maintain all existing functionality

## File Structure:
```
public/
  images/
    max-verstappen.jpg  ← Save the image here
